/*

	These files are in the order they are in (the ones with number-) because they need to be uglified/concat'd/etc before the other files due to dependencies, and we use a process to uglify/concatenate our JS files that reads the folder contents in order alphabetically. The files that don't have any kind of numerical designation do not have dependencies that require reordering.
